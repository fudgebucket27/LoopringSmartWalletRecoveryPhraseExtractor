# LoopringSmartWalletRecoveryPhraseExtractor
## What is this?
This is a tool to extract the Recovery Phrase and L1 Private Key for the OWNER wallet of a Loopring Smart Wallet via the Loopring Migration QR Code. 

Behind every Ethereum Layer 1 activated Loopring smart wallet is a hidden wallet known as an owner. This owner wallet has control over your Loopring smart wallet and even has a layer 1 private key. You can use this layer 1 private key to sign requests on behalf of your Loopring smart wallet to the Loopring API and in Loopring airdrop tools like [Maize](https://github.com/cobmin/Maize)

## Important
